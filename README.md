This bot was designed to level your hearthstone heroes to 60 by setting up two
 accounts, a "winner" that gets the experience, and a "loser" that forfeits
 every match to give the winner XP. Mouse over the play button and press F3
 to save the position.  Press F4 when your mouse is over the concede button
 in the menu. Green squares should appear under each to show that the position
 has been saved.  To start the bot, press F1, and another green square should 
 show up in the middle of the window. Timer delay 1 is the short delay between 
 clicks to the screen and timer delay 2 is the long delay between clicking 
 play, and clicking concede while waiting for the game to load.

The winner only needs the play position, and timer delay 1 set, as all the
winner does is click where the play button is.

The loser needs all fields filled.

This bot is most likely outdated as I haven't played hearthstone since the
naxx expansion and haven't checked if it works anymore.
